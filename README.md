# C++-multieffects-processor
This is a piece of code i did for my final year project in university, it is an audio multi effects processor that can stream audio from an audio device an apply various effects to it before outputting the sound through the speakers. to use this code you must have the portaudio engine installed on your computer otherwise it won't compile, check http://portaudio.com/ for download links and installation instructions. I built the code in MS visual studio
